[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=49FYWEP529NH6)

Annoyed by bloated and inefficient calorie counter apps with tons of features you will never use?

Well, I am glad you are here, because I am developing a solution to that problem.

# You can support this project
You can fork my repo and resolve issues that you can find in the Issues tab and once you resolved an issue, open a pull request from your fork.

You can also create new issues with tags like: feature_request, bug, or feedback.

I will expand this readme if my creativity comes back.
