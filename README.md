SFCC - SIMPLE FUCKING CALORIE COUNTER

Simple Calorie Counter app, since apparently nobody on this planet is able to fulfill the simple usecases of tracking your nutrition with an intuitive and simple ui.
No, instead everyone blows their app up with useless features and tries to make it a social media platform.
Why not call it Fatbook then?
